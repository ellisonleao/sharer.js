# Contributing to sharer.js

It's so nice you want to contribute to our library! But we still need to keep some rules in order to make the development on sync.

A good development cycle can be described as the following:

- Clone repo and install dev requirements

```
git clone git@github.com:ellisonleao:sharer.js
cd sharer.js
npm install
```

- Create a branch of your feature/fix

```
git checkout -b my-awesome-feature
```

- Make the code changes like there will be no tomorrow.

- Make sure no lint errors are raised.

```
npm lint
```

- Open pull request.

- Wait for our feedback!

That's it!
